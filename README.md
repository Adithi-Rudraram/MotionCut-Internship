# WEEK - 1 TO - DO LIST
Welcome to the To-Do List application developed during my Week 1 internship project at MotionCut!

This application contains 7 different options 
1. Add Task
2. Display Tasks
3. Mark Task as Completed
4. Update Task
5. Remove Task
6. Display Completed Tasks
7. Exit

These features collectively create a to do list, offering users the ability to add, view, update, and remove tasks, as well as completed tasks.
